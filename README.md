# Quote Generator
This is a developing project by 5 undergraduate computer science students. 
Our mission is to create an application in which a user can input their
current mood and receive a quote to either enhance their mood or motivate 
them. 
In addition, we are hoping to integrate this as a social media service 
in which users can react to their friends' quotes and post their own.
## Goals

-[] - Determine what languages/frameworks we are using.
-[] - Assign duties.
